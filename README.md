# 2012-flaresoftware

#### Description

One of the first websites I created back in 2012. There are links to 3 iOS apps that I had developed and released by that point: Xellic (The sequel, I made the next year hit the top charts for a couple days, around the world, for most downloaded free app), City Sky (my first game), and Boondoggle (Knot tying instructions, included a 'lite' version as well). About that time, I had developed a couple marketing websites that are seen on the right-hand side of the page. The first design for this site is lost to history, the contents of this repo are the oldest version I've found.
